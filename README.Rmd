# smstests

The goal of smstests is to produce simple multivariate statistical tests for means and variances / covariances for one single factor with two or more levels, including multiple t- and Levene tests, Hotelling’s T^2 test, extended Levene tests, one-way MANOVA, van Valen’s test and Box’s M test.

## Installation

You can install the development version of smstests from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

## Example

```{r example}
library(smstests)
## basic example code
data(skulls)
# Box's M test using an F-approximation
BoxM.skulls <- BoxM.F(skulls, Period)
summary.BoxM.F(BoxM.skulls, long = TRUE)
```
