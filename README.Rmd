# smstests

The goal of **smstests** is to produce simple multivariate statistical tests for means and variances / covariances for one single factor with two or more levels, including multiple two-sample t- and Levene's tests, Hotelling’s $T^2$ test, extended two-sample Levene's tests for multivariate data, one-way MANOVA, van Valen’s test and Box’s M test. In addition, **smstests** offers one function for the calculation of multivariate distances: Penrose's

## Installation

You can install the development version of smstests from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, install, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools") # In case devtools is not installed
devtools::install_github("ganava4/smstests")
```

## Example

```{r example, comment = ""}
library(smstests)
## basic example code
data(skulls)
# Box's M test using an F-approximation
BoxM.skulls <- BoxM.F(skulls, Period)
summary.BoxM.F(BoxM.skulls, long = TRUE)
```
