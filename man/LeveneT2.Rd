\title{Levene's test based on Hotelling's \eqn{T^2} test with extra
information}
\usage{
LeveneT2(x, group, level1, var.equal = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data frame with one two-level factor and \emph{p} response
variables.}

\item{group}{two-level factor defining groups. It must be one of the columns
in \code{x}.}

\item{level1}{a character string identifying Sample 1. The string must be one
of the factor levels in \code{group}.}

\item{var.equal}{a logical variable indicating whether to treat the
within-sample covariance matrices of absolute deviations around medians for
samples 1 and 2 as equal or not. The default is \code{TRUE}. If the
within-sample covariance matrices of absolute deviations around medians are
not assumed equal (\code{FALSE}), Hotelling's \code{T^2} test is performed
using the Nel and van der Merwe's (1986) solution to the multivariate
Behrens-Fisher problem as implemented in \pkg{Hotelling} package (Curran and
Hersh, 2021).}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class \code{"LeveneT2"}, a list containing the
following components:
\tabular{llllllllllll}{
\code{ name} \tab A character string describing the function. \cr
\code{medians} \tab A list containing two vectors. The first vector
\code{medians1} contains the medians for all variables in sample 1 as
declared in parameter \code{level1}, and the second vector holds the
corresponding medians for the other sample. \cr

\code{matlevel2} containing the original variables for samples 1 and 2
respectively  \cr
\code{absdev.median} \tab A list with two data frames
\code{abs.dev.median1} and \code{abs.dev.median2} containing the absolute
deviations from sample medians for samples 1 and 2, respectively. \cr
\code{LeveneT2.test} \tab A list of class \code{hotelling.test} containing
the list \code{stats} and the scalar \code{pval}, produced by function
\code{\link[Hotelling]{hotelling.test}} implemented in package
\pkg{Hotelling} \cr

variances were treated as being equal \code{TRUE} or not \code{FALSE}. \cr
\code{group} \tab a character string specifying the name of the two-level
factor defining groups.  \cr
\code{levels.group} \tab a vector of length two, showing the two levels in
factor \code{group}.  \cr

\description{
An R function for the comparison of multivariate variation in two samples,
which implements Levene's test based on Hotelling's \eqn{T^2}.
}
\details{
\code{LeveneT2} makes use of Hotelling's \eqn{T^2} to test the variation in
two multivariate samples. This test is an alternative procedure that should
be more robust than Box's test which is known to be rather sensitive to the
assumption that the samples are from multivariate normal distributions.

In \code{LeveneT2} the data values are transformed into absolute deviations
from their respective sample medians

\deqn{ADM_{ijk} = |x_{ijk}-M_{jk}|}

where

\eqn{x_{ijk}} is the value of variable \eqn{X_{k}} for the \eqn{i}th
individual in sample \eqn{j}, and

\eqn{M_{jk}} is the median of \eqn{X_{k}} in sample \eqn{j}.

The unequal variation question between samples \eqn{j = 1} and \eqn{j = 2}
becomes a \eqn{T^2}-test for the difference of the mean \eqn{ADM} vectors.
